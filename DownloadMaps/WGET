# DOWNLOAD PROCESS USING WGET

example SANBORN url iteration:\
- first image: http://sanborn1.proquest.com/Downloads/?m=639092
- last image: http://sanborn1.proquest.com/Downloads/?m=639101
- iteration: http://sanborn1.proquest.com/Downloads/?m=639{092..101}}

FIMO downloading
- issue: enclosed within a leaflet
- solution: "inspect element" gives us the text enclosed in "inspect element example" file. Find "src = " for the source jpg. After trying a few options, the following URLs will download each file sequentially. Where it says "1024" you can input a resolution for download. The other numbers seems to specify a zoom location, but it's unclear what exactly they do - but they seem to be necessary.

### example of source url gained from inspecting element:\

https://higimage.com/fullres_images/09315_01_1893/9/0000R.jpg/0,0,5874,8192/1024,/0/default.jpg"

explanation:
**"5874,8192"** sets the bounds for how tall and wide the image is. You just need to use a large enough range to capture the whole image (eg, 10000,10000)

**1024** sets image resolution. 1024 seems to be the max for this method.

**09315_01_1893** sets the city_volume_year

**9** sets

**0000R.jpg** sets the page in the volume

### Setup 1: construct url list using FIMO_file_list.xlsx, and copy to FIMOlist.txt
- url list is constructed by inputing city numbers, volume, and year, and then copying final list to txt file

### Setup 2: place FIMOlist.txt in download directory

### bash shell 1: cd /downloaddirectory/

### bash shell 2: login to server (EXAMPLE USING FIMO FROM FT VANCOUVER LIBRARY)
wget --no-check-certificate \
      --save-cookies cookies.txt \
     --keep-session-cookies \
     --post-data 'user=778797&password=7743' \
     --delete-after \
     https://access.fvrl.org/login?qurl=https%3A//fims.historicalinfo.com/FIMS.aspx

### bash shell 3: WGET files from list

wget --no-check-certificate --content-on-error -i FIMOlist.txt

### Final step: rename to standard format
(Eg, using Mac OS Finder rename utility)
Learn os. method to rename!

### TIP: download all left pages first, then right pages. It makes it easier to batch rename.
