# Detecting Coal Gasification using OpenCV #

This is a project at Brown University aimed at detecting the historic locations of coal gasification plants using digitized Sanborn maps and OpenCV.

Coal Gasification plants have a distinct shape on sanborn maps making their detection using computer vision packages like [OpenCV]{https://opencv.org/}.
